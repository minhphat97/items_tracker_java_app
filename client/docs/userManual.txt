The Consumables Tracker application GUI will show you general interface which includes buttons
All, Expired, Not Expired, Expiring in 7 Days, Remove and Add Item.

First of all, you have run web server, then you run GUI client 

1. Click All button to list available items that has been stored
2. Click Expired button to list expired items that has been stored
3. Click Not Expired button to list not expired items that has been stored
4. Click Expiring in 7 Days button to list items that will be expired in 7 days
5. Click Add Item to add one more item which could be drink or food item. If you enter empty name,
negative or empty price, weight or value, there will show a warning dialog. 
6. Click Remove to display a dialog that require you to enter the number item that you want to 
remove. If you enter a number item that is not in the list, there will show a warning dialog.
However, there is a bit special here. Because sometimes when you want to remove an item by specific ID, 
the communication between server and client is not good. Therefore, server cannot remove that item. But you can
try again to remove that item.
